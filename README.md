Biogenesis is an artificial life program that simulates the processes involved 
in the evolution of organisms. It shows colored segment based organisms that 
mutate and evolve in a 2D environment. Biogenesis is based on Primordial Life.

This repo contains my own changes to the Biogenesis source code.
See http://biogenesis.sourceforge.net/ for original application.
